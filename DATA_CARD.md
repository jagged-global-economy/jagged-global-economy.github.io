# Data Card

## Dataset Description

The release contains derived aggregate CSV tables for a national AI exposure
analysis. The central metric aggregates occupation-level AI exposure scores
over national occupational employment shares.

## Data Sources

Upstream sources include Gmyrek et al. occupational exposure scores, ILOSTAT
occupational employment and wage/labor-share inputs, World Bank national
indicators and classifications, KNOMAD bilateral remittance matrices, and
provider-published aggregate AI usage/adoption statistics. The Microsoft
AI Diffusion country/economy table is redistributed from Microsoft's
official MIT-licensed GitHub data release after ISO alpha-3 matching.
Hosseini Maasoum and Lichtinger transformed score vectors are not
redistributed; the release includes aggregate robustness statistics and
source links only.

## Responsible AI Notes

- No synthetic data are included.
- No individual-level records or direct personal identifiers are included.
- Country-level and occupation-level aggregates can still be sensitive in
  policy contexts and should be interpreted carefully.
- Exposure is a structural measure of economic relevance, not a job-loss
  measure.
- Missing major economies and uneven source-data coverage limit
  generalization.

## Redistribution

This release redistributes derived aggregate tables and selected
provider-reported aggregate values where permitted. Raw upstream source files
and API mirrors are not included. For Microsoft AI Diffusion, the
official country/economy data are included under the upstream MIT license;
for Hosseini Maasoum and Lichtinger, transformed score vectors are
omitted. Users should consult the source-data manifest for original
provider terms and citations.
